## Overview
Smart Flight leverages **Semantic Kernel** to intelligently interact with back-office systems, providing users with seamless, human-like communication during the flight booking process. By integrating this AI technology into the existing system, Smart Flight delivers an enhanced user experience while maintaining enterprise-level data security and efficiency.

## Features
- **AI-Driven Interaction**: Utilize Semantic Kernel to dynamically query back-end systems for flight availability.
- **Enterprise Integration**: Seamlessly incorporated into an existing enterprise flight booking system.
- **User-Centric Design**: Smart, adaptive UI designed to guide users intuitively through the booking process.
- **Secure Backend Interaction**: Maintains clear separation between sensitive data and AI-accessible information.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 6.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (for frontend builds, if applicable)
- PostgreSQL Database Server

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-flight.git
   cd smart-flight
   ```
2. Set up the database:
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
   - Run the SQL scripts provided in `db_setup/` to initialize the database.

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. Build and run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

### Configuration
- Configure the Semantic Kernel settings in `appsettings.json`:
   ```json
   {
       "SemanticKernel": {
           "Endpoint": "your-sk-endpoint",
           "APIKey": "your-sk-api-key"
       }
   }
   ```

## Technologies Used
- **ASP.NET Core MVC Framework**: For backend development and dependency injection.
- **Semantic Kernel**: AI-driven functionality for seamless back-end interaction.
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational database for storing flight and booking data.
- **OAuth & JWT**: Secure authorization mechanisms.

---

## Usage
1. **Search Flights**: Use the search bar to enter your query. Semantic Kernel intelligently retrieves flight availability.
2. **Book Flights**: Interact naturally with the AI-driven system to finalize bookings.
3. **Data Security**: The system ensures sensitive enterprise data is not exposed to AI, maintaining a clear boundary between accessible and non-accessible data.
